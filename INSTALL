    CAEN Dig2

    Install procedure on Linux.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Prerequisites
-------------

- A compiler supporting C++14, C++17 or C++20.
  The following compiler versions have been tested on x86_64:
  - GCC >= 5 (up to version 14)
  - clang >= 3.8 (up to version 18*)
- CAEN FELib >= 1.3.0
- Boost C++ libraries (headers only, see build instructions).
  The following Boost versions have been tested on x86_64:
  - 1.67, 1.74, 1.83

*) versions >= 16 require Boost >= 1.81


Install
-------

In the extracted folder run

    $ ./configure --disable-assert
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig


Boost C++ libraries
-------------------

The most recent distributions provides Boost >= 1.67.0 with their package managers.
If your Linux distribution provides an older version of Boost libraries, just download
the sources of Boost 1.67.0 from https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_67_0.html,
extract them in any folder, and run configure using the `--with-boost` flag.

There is no need to compile Boost, as Boost shared libraries are not required at runtime.

For example if you have extracted it in `/opt/boost_1_67_0`, execute:

    $ ./configure --disable-assert --with-boost="/opt/boost_1_67_0"

Then, just make as usual.
